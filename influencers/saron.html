      <h1><b>SARON YITBAREK: Founder of <a href="http://codenewbie.com">CodeNewbie</a>, the most supportive community of programmers and people learning to code.</b></h1>
      <h3>Tell us about yourself! Who are you and what do you do?</h3>
      <h2>I’m the founder of CodeNewbie, the most supportive community of programmers and people learning to code. I’m host of the CodeNewbie Podcast and currently organizing <a href="http://codelandconf.com/">Codeland</a>, our first conference. I’m also an organizer for Make A Diff, a community of developers who want to use their tech powers for good.
      </h2>
      <h3>When you were just learning to code, what made you stick with it?</h3>
      <h2>When things finally worked, it was just enough of a win to keep me going when things were hard and didn’t make any sense. Once I found my own community of coders on the same journey, feeling less alone really helped.
      </h2>
      <h3>You also make cartoons! How did you get started with that, and what are some of your plans with drawing in the future?</h3>
      <h2>I learned to draw when I was little because my dad was a great artist and I wanted to make the things he could. I never quite got on his level, but I learned enough to tell stories. Drawing’s a tool I use ever so often when it’s the right solution to a problem, but I don’t have any plans with it.
      </h2>
      <h3>You seems to spend a lot of time online; what are some of your favorite corners of the internet?</h3>
      <h2>I spend most of my time between Twitter, the New York Times, and sometimes Medium. Between the three of those, I usually end up on top of things.</h2>
