The opaque, agnostic wondering of an unrequited DM and the guilt of an unread tab. Mania in the dopamine fave loop. The letting-go spiral of going viral, scattering your narrative to the cyberwinds (BuzzFeed take the wheel). Warmth from the candles of a table-for-two email. Circuitous integration with a zeitgeist. The sleepover-party-sleeping-bag whisper of night Twitter, a nauseous momentum from scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, and a million kinds of unfocused love for a network that somehow manages to be boundaryless yet intimate."<br> <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherboard.vice.com%2Fread%2Fnegotiations-at-the-irlurl-border&t=M2IxODg2M2ZmY2NlOTVhMmEzY2U5NmI2ZDJmOGMwNWNiZWM0YTYzMCxvbkt2UFFPTA%3D%3D">negotiations at the irl/url border</a>',

        '"We often think of online activism as a shallow bid for fleeting attention, but the movement that Mckesson is helping to lead has been able to sustain the country&#39;s focus and reach millions of people. Among many black Americans, long accustomed to mistreatment or worse at the hands of the police, the past year has brought on an incalculable sense of anger and despair. For the nation as a whole, we have come to learn the names of the victims - Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Tony Robinson, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray - because the activists have linked their fates together in our minds, despite their separation by many weeks and thousands of miles."<br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/magazine/our-demand-is-simple-stop-killing-us.html?gwh=0C54D6AB947F4118CC7BBD137728A82C&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now&_r=0">our demand is simple: stop killing us</a>',

I reflect upon what we can do to begin to heal from the pain of the past and the pain of the present like Freddie Gray&#39;s murder.

Schwarz and being fitted for shoes at Best&#39;s and then waiting under the Biltmore clock and dancing to Lester Lanin, New York is just a city, albeit the city, a plausible place for people to live, But to those of us who came from places where no one had heard of Lester Lanin and Grand Central Station was a Saturday radio program, where Wall Street and Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue were not places at all but abstractions (&#39;Money,&#39; and &#39;High Fashion,&#39; and &#39;The Hucksters&#39;), New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself.
